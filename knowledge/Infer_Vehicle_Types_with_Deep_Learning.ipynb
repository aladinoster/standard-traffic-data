    "In our previous analysis we saw that it seems that there are issues with pedestrians objects in SUMo MoST. The idea behind this notebook is to use deep learning to correctly classify the types of such vehicles. We will use all the other vehicles as a learning set for our model, then use this model to identify \"fake\" pedestrians.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Deep Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data set can be thought as composed by multivariate time-series (after proper manipulation) of vehicles trip around Monaco area. As we know, SKTimes is the \"SKLearn version for time-series\", and as a package conceived specifically to treat this kind of data, is meant to provide better results than deep learning for multivariate classification. So why approach this problem with deep learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is that this article is meant exactly to provide a comparison with [the work of another author with SKTimes](notebook_link), hoping such comparison would allow to draw interesting conclusions. So, we will use TensorFlow to build a neural network to approach this problem.\n",
